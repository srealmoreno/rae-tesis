## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there are any vulnerabilities in this project, don't hesitate to _report them_.

1. Use any of the [private contact addresses](mailto:report-vulnerability@raetesis.ml).
2. Describe the vulnerability.

- If you have a fix, that is most welcome -- please attach or summarize it in your
  message!

1. We will evaluate the vulnerability and, if necessary, release a fix or mitigating
   steps to address it. We will contact you to let you know the outcome, and will
   credit you in the report.

- Please **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until a fix is released!

1. Once we have either a) published a fix, or b) declined to address the vulnerability
   for whatever reason, you are free to publicly disclose it.
